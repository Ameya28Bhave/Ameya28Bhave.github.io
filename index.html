            <p>I am a final year graduate student pursuing MS in Computer Science from University of Maryland, Baltimore County and will be graduating in May-2024.
                My <a href="CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> . 
                I am currently looking for roles as a Software Developer. I have 3 years of relevant work experience in 
                the tech industry having worked as an Application Development Analyst at Accenture in Mumbai 
                from October 2018 to November 2021. I have also completed work on Full Stack web app development projects using MERN stack. 
                My current research interests lie in Quantum Computing, AI, Machine Learning. My current research work under 
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aborle/" target="_blank">Dr. Ajinkya Borle</a> is in the implementation of the
                Biclustering algorithm using photonic quantum computing. Prior to this work I was also engaged in various other academic projects 
                and research. I have published papers in quantum annealing and the integration of brain-computer interfaces with virtual reality. 
                My recent projects include simulations of the HHL algorithm using Qiskit, the development of a quantum-accelerated simulated 
                annealing algorithm, and a literature review on quantum natural language processing. Before joining UMBC I completed my Bachelor's degree 
                in Computer Engineering from University of Mumbai, in 2018.</p>
