            <p>I am a final year graduate student pursuing MS in Computer Science from University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
                My current research interests lie in Quantum Computing. My current reserach work under 
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aborle/" target="_blank">Dr. Ajinkya Borle</a> is in the implementation of the
                Biclustering algorithm using photonic quantum computing. Prior to this work I was also engaged in various other academic projects 
                and research. I have published papers on quantum annealing and the integration of brain-computer interfaces with virtual reality. 
                My recent projects include simulations of the HHL algorithm using Qiskit, the development of a quantum-accelerated simulated 
                annealing algorithm, and a literature review on quantum natural language processing.
            </p>
            <p>Before joining UMBC I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from University of Mumbai, 
                in 2018. Following my undergraduate studies, I worked as an Application Development Analyst at Accenture in Mumbai 
                from October 2018 to November 2021.</p>
