# Ameya Bhave — Portfolio

## About
I'm a PhD student at The University of Texas at Dallas, working at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. My research focuses on developing novel approaches to Quantum Error Correction and designing efficient quantum algorithms.

Before diving into academia, I spent over three years at Accenture as an Application Development Analyst, where I honed my skills in building scalable software solutions. This industry experience gives me a unique perspective on translating theoretical advances into practical applications.

When I'm not wrestling with qubits, you'll find me exploring full-stack development, contributing to open-source projects, or diving into the latest advances in AI.
